# ChainTree

A ChainTree is a new data structure that represents both digital and physical objects in Tupelo.

Please see our [documentation](https://docs.quorumcontrol.com/docs/chaintree.html) to learn more.

## Development
### Linting
We use [golangci-lint](https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint) for linting, which is
basically an aggregator of individual linters. You can most easily run it via `make lint`,
which will also install it if necessary.
